### Step #1:Install Java for Elastic Stack on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
#### Start by updating your systemâ€™s package index.
```sh
sudo apt update
```

#### Install the apt-transport-https package to access repository over HTTPS.
```sh
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
```

#### Elastic Stack components require Java. We will install OpenJDK 11, which is a widely used open-source implementation of the Java Platform.

```sh
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```

#### After installation, verify that Java is correctly installed by checking its version.
```sh
java -version
```

#### To ensure stack components can locate Java, we need to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable. Open the environment file.

```sh
sudo nano /etc/environment
```

Add the following line at the end of the file.
```sh
JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64"
```
Apply the changes by reloading the environment.
```sh
source /etc/environment
```

Verify that JAVA_HOME is set correctly.
```sh
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

### Step #2:Install ElasticSearch on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
#### Elasticsearch is the core component of the ELK Stack, used for search and analytics. We need to import the public signing key and add the Elasticsearch APT repository to your system.
```sh
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
```

#### Add the repository definition.
```sh
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/apt stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-8.x.list
```

#### Update the package lists again to include the new Elasticsearch repository.
