## ✅ Basic Recommendeds for Prometheus

### 🔍 To find how many days of data Prometheus stores: 
Prometheus uses the --storage.tsdb.retention.time flag to define how long data is retained.  
Run this command to check the current retention setting:
```
ps aux | grep prometheus
```
If this flag is not set, Prometheus defaults to 15 days.
### 📦 To check how much space is currently used:
This will give you the total size of the prometheus storage directory in a human-readable format (e.g., MB/GB).
```
du -sh /var/lib/prometheus
```

### To view the Full Prometheus Error Message:
This will show the last 20 lines of logs for the Prometheus service.
```
sudo journalctl -u prometheus.service --no-pager -n 20
```
